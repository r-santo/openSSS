# openSSS

 openSSS is an open source implementation of scatter estimation for 3D TOF-PET based on the TOF-aware Single Scatter Simulation (SSS) algorithm proposed by Watson [1]. It is compatible with any reconstruction platform. This implementation is in Matlab, tested on version R2021b.
 
 It was validated for three pet system geometries, on Monte-Carlo simulated data and two vendor's specific reconstruction platforms. The results have been submit to IEEE MIC2023 and are currently being prepared for publication.
 
 openSSS was developed at UMC Utrecht by Rodrigo José Santo, with the contribution of André Salomon, Hugo de Jong, Thibaut Merlin, Simon Stute, Casper Beijst.
