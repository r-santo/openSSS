# openSSS

 openSSS is an open source implementation of scatter estimation for 3D TOF-PET based on the TOF-aware Single Scatter Simulation (SSS) algorithm proposed by Watson [1]. It is compatible with any reconstruction platform. This implementation is in Matlab, tested on version R2021b.
 
 It was validated for three pet system geometries, on Monte-Carlo simulated data and two vendor's specific reconstruction platforms. The results have been accepted for an oral presentation at IEEE MIC2023:
